/*Using manifest.json, you specify basic metadata about your extension such as the name and version,
and can also specify aspects of your extension's functionality, such as background scripts, content scripts, and browser actions.

The web app manifest is a simple JSON file that tells the browser about your web application
and how it should behave when 'installed' on the user's mobile device or desktop.
Having a manifest is required by Chrome to show the Add to Home Screen prompt.
